# This example shows how to use the Property Helper convenience method
# to access and modify model component properties. This method is 
# needed when you want to modify a property that does not have an 
# available custom "set" method.
#
# The model used is the simple Bouncing Block model included with
# the OpenSim distribution. It modifies the properties of one of
# the bushings in the model
import os.path

# Load the model and get handle 
loadModel( os.path.join(getResourcesDir(), "Models", "BouncingBlock", "bouncing_block.osim"))
currentModel = getCurrentModel()

# Create a new copy
myModel = modeling.Model(currentModel)

# Name the copy for later display in the GUI
currentName = myModel.getName()
myModel.setName(currentName+"_edited")

# Initialize the copy, if values need to be set in the model's state
# pass along the variable myState  returned by initSystem
myState = myModel.initSystem()

# Change the mass of the block body. This property has a custom
# "set" function that we can use to change the mass
block = myModel.getBodySet().get("block")
block.setMass(100)

# Change the hip bushing stiffness using the property helper
# since a custom get method like used above is not available

# Get an editable handle to the property, using downcast to 
# specify for the scripting shell that this is a BushingForce
hipBushing = modeling.BushingForce.safeDownCast(myModel.getForceSet().get("hip_bushing"))

# Get the current stiffness, as SimTK Vec3 
currentStiffness = hipBushing.get_rotational_stiffness()

# Double the stiffness.
newStiffness = modeling.Vec3()
for i in range(0,3):
   newStiffness.set(i,2*currentStiffness.get(i))
hipBushing.set_rotational_stiffness(newStiffness)

# Get full path name of original.old model
fullPathName = currentModel.getInputFileName()

# Change the name of the modified model
newName = fullPathName.replace('.osim', '_edited.osim')
myModel.print(newName)

# Load the model in the GUI
loadModel(newName)
