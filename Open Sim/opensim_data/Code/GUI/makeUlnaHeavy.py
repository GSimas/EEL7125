# OpenSim is a toolkit for musculoskeletal modeling and simulation,           #
# developed as an open source project by a worldwide community. Development   #
# and support is coordinated from Stanford University, with funding from the  #
# U.S. NIH and DARPA. See http://opensim.stanford.edu and the README file     #

# This example shows how to load a model and create a modified version of the model
# The script increases the mass of the ulna. The modified model is then loaded in the GUI.
import os.path

# Get handle to the Arm26 model
oldModel = modeling.Model(os.path.join(getResourcesDir(), "Models", "Arm26", "Arm26.osim"))
# Create a fresh copy
myModel = modeling.Model(oldModel)

# Initialize the copy, if values need to be set in the model's state
# pass along the variable myState  returned by initSystem
myState = myModel.initSystem()

# Name the copy for later display in the GUI
oldName = oldModel.getName()
myModel.setName(oldName+"_heavier")

# A scale factor for mass of forarm
massScale = 3

# Change mass of forarm in the model
forearm = myModel.getBodySet().get("r_ulna_radius_hand")
forearm.setMass(forearm.getMass() * massScale)

# Get full path name of original.old model
fullPathName = oldModel.getInputFileName()

# Change the name of the modified model
newName = fullPathName.replace('.osim', '_heavier.osim')
myModel.print(newName)

# Load the model in the GUI
loadModel(newName)
